## User Story   
While searching keyword in Google, the websites appearing in the top search results are all advertisement. As for shopping website like Amazon, the results with Sponsor are all advertising. They makes customers who have interest in those items tends to improve the possibility of buying the one with advertisement.  
Internet giants such as Google and Facebook rely mainly on advertising revenue. Advertising system design and optimization require a large amount of advertising system knowledge, distributed system optimization, machine learning and big data processing skills.      
By calculating the relativity between the user's query and the ads provided by merchants, this ads searching system displays the most relevant ads that users are most interested in so that user are more likely to click the ads.  
In the meantime, merchants can easily target the most potential customers and put the right ads with the lowest cost.  

## Data Structure    
  *  Advertiser:      
      *  Create Ads associated with bid price   
      *  Bid for position     
      *  Pay by CPC (cost per click)    
  *  User:
      *  Send query to search engine, expressing some intent    
  *   Search Engine:      
      *  execute query against web corpus   
      *  execute query against ads corpus   
      *  Display search result page : web result, ads     

## How does it work:  
1. Merchants provide a list of ads which contain keywords, bid price, and total budget. Our system store all the information and build the forwarded and inverted indexes.    
2. When user types the query on the search box, the system parses the query and calculates the relevant score between the query and the ads. Then the system processes a workflow to select, filter, price, and allocate the relevant ads.    
3. Finally the ads is sent and displayed to the user interface. 
     
Note:  
* Search Ads
    *  logic:      
        *  match ad's key words to users' query    
    *  Ads format:
        *  text
        *  image
    *  Ads position:      
        *  main line, side bar, top, bottom of search result.
* Ads keyword
    * Campaign
      * A campaign focuses on a theme or a group of products
    * set a budget
    * Pclick: it is a frequency number of clicks among 100 times release.
    * Relevant Score: it is the ratio of number of keywords in query and number of keywords in matched ads.
    * Quality Score: it is corelated to Pclick and relevant score, allows system to rank ads.

## Ads Searching System Schema:  
### Query Understanding:  
   *  Cleaning:
       *  remove stop words: a, an, the ...
       *  remove ending s, â€˜s
   *  Query Understanding:
       *  i like soxxxfa -> sofa
   Result: a list of query    
### Select Ads:   
  *  send query understand result to index and select as much candidates as possible  
  *  apply information retrieval algorithm on index server   
### Rank Ads:  
  *  rank ads according rank scores:  
     *  relevance between query and ad   
     *  click probability   
     *  bid price   
### Select Top K ads
  *  Top K ads are selected to be displayed in front of users according to the rank scores.

### Inverted Index and Forwarded Index:

Inverted Index is built in Memcached, while forwarde index is built in MongoDB.

## Web Crawler
Making requests and extracting data from the response.
Two design choice
 * Parse HTML page synchronously
 * Parse HTML page asynchronously  
   
Comparision:  
* Synchronously  
   * Pros: Save disk space  
   * Cons:   
          1. If need extract more data then have to crawl again  
          2. Crawling is blocked by parsing HTML  
* Asynchronously
   * Pros:   
          1. Re-parse HTML if needed  
          2. unblock crawling from parsing HTML
   * Cons:   
          1. Need more storage space  
          2. Need more machines or CPU to parse HTML

Where to start crawling
   * start with feeds file
   * a list of website url
   * request url with different parameter
   * sample feeds file
  
Challenge:
* Network I/O(using multi-threaded and non-blocking IO)
* Avoid Bot Detection(using Spook Http Headers and Proxy Service)
* Crawler needed to be resilient(log crawled url&failed url&exception)
